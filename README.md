this is about socrates' play antigone
in the game you play as creon and have to make decisions etc etc
the idea is to prove the lesson that a dictator doesn't respect any conditions but their own, and their reputation only matters in extremes.

my teacher actually approved this, i have no idea why.
made in cmu graphics because the other dude working in the project only took the intro to computer science class and doesn't know any other object oriented languages that would be useful to make a game like this.
